# Primorial of a number
Given a number n, the task is to calculate its primorial. Primorial (denoted as Pn#) is product of first n prime numbers. Primorial of a number is similar to factorial of a number. In primorial, not all the natural numbers get multiplied only prime numbers are multiplied to calculate the primorial of a number. It is denoted with P#.

-Input: n = 3

-Output: 30 

-Priomorial = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30

-factorial is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
